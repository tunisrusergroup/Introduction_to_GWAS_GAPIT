# Introduction_to_GWAS_GAPIT

We are happy to announce the start of our activities again within Tunis R User Group.

Our online workshop serve as an introduction to Genome-Wide Association Study using GAPIT. Join us to meet Andy Chen.

➡️ About the workshop
During this workshop you will get introduced to the Genome-Wide Association and the R package GAPIT (https://github.com/jiabowang/GAPIT).

GWAS is a method to identify genes associated with particular traits by scanning the genomes from many different individuals for markers. This can help scientists identify genetic variations linked to a particular disease or trait.

During this session, you'll understand the basic steps of running GAPIT and the plots and outputs that are generated thanks to a practical example.

➡️ Speaker

Andy Chen is an aspiring plant breeder with an M.Sc. in plant genetics and breeding from the University of Guelph, where he studied with the late Professors Alireza Navabi and Professors Istvan Rajcan. During this time, he developed a new phenotyping method and identified genetic markers that could improve the winter-hardiness of winter wheat using GWAS. He is currently a final-year PhD student at the John Innes Centre in the UK, working with Professor Cristobal Uauy. Andy's current research focuses on utilizing genomic resources to identify wheat genes and new variations that can improve yield, agronomic performance, and end-use quality.
